# Warning:
This library is old and I will likely not release any further versions after [1.1](https://github.com/vaclavak/Java-Transform-Library-JTL-/releases), right now I am working on other projects like [ConsoleToolbox](https://github.com/vaclavak/ConsoleToolbox), I may change my mind, but it will propably be like this

Also the src code the .metadata is an eclipse config folder, im too lazy to remove it so if u use eclipse good for u I guess.
